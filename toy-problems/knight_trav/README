KNIGHT_TRAV - An implementation of the Knight's Travail problem.
================================================================


Introduction
=============

This repository contains a full solution to the knight's travail problem
posited by Integrated Research.  


Repository Contents
===================

 - Build scripts
 - Source code (all standard C++ 2003, STL and Boost)
 - Unit tests (downloads GoogleTest automatically)
 - Documentation


The Documentation folder contains discussion of pros/cons of the chosen solution
and an overview of the software and its design.


Prerequisites
============

This version of knight_trav currently only builds on 'nix systems.  It's been
tested on Mac OS X 10.8 and Ubuntu 12.04.  However the program uses only standard C++, STL 
and Boost, thus combined with the use of cmake means it should also function on 
Windows with a suitable bootstrap script (not provided at this time).

 - 'nix (Ubuntu, Mac OS X verified)
 - Boost (tested on 1.46, 1.50)
 - Command line tools (on Mac OS X 10.8)
 - cmake 2.8+
 - git (not essential but recommended)


 Installing Prequisites 
 =====================

 Ubuntu
 ======

 sudo apt-get install git cmake libboost-all-dev

 Mac OS X
 ========

 Using MacPorts (http://www.macports.org/install.php):

 sudo port install git-core cmake boost

 Install XCode developer tools from Apple's App store (wish I had a port for that!)
 Update XCode (via Preferences) to install Command Line Tools.


 Installing
 =====

 Assuming you've received the repository as a tgz, first extract it:

 tar xzf knight_travail.tgz

 1. Run bootstrap 

    cd knight_travail
    ./bootstrap.sh
 
    This will initialize the build system.
 
 2. Build knight_travail and unit tests: 

    cd Build
    make

 3. Run the unit-tests
    ./unittest-all


Usage
======

From the Build directory, run knight_travail with the help option.

./knight_travail --help

A typical usage example would be,

./knight_travail
$ A5 G5
$ B3 C5 E6 G5

Invalid input will generate an error message.
