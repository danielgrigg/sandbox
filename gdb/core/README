CORE

Why Core? Because it was to test some core dump stuff and became a gdb sandbox instead..
Go figure.

BUILDING

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .
make .

Running
See trace_breaks.gdb and core.cpp.  When run they'll log whenever two breakpoints are hit.
See dump_breaks.gdb for an example of logging to files.

eg,
gdb core -x trace_breaks.gdb

then send a SIGABRT,
kill -s SIGABRT <core pid>
