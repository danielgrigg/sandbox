#     MallocCheckHeapAbort 

#     MallocErrorAbort             If set, causes abort(3) to be called if an error was encountered in malloc(3)
#                                  or free(3) , such as a calling free(3) on a pointer previously freed.

#     MallocCorruptionAbort        Similar to MallocErrorAbort but will not abort in out of memory conditions,
#                                  making it more useful to catch only those errors which will cause memory cor-
#                                  ruption.  MallocCorruptionAbort is always set on 64-bit processes.
