cpp11_threads
=============

Testing c++11 threading facilities, which aren't bad (well, for horrid multithreading).

threads, condition variables and futures oh-my!

Pity there's no thread pools, dispatch queues or higher level methods like 
maps etc..

Building
========

cmake . && make && ./cpp11_threads

Notes
======

Only tested on mac os x 10.8 with clang 4.1.
