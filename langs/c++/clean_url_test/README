Introduction
============

clean_url_test runs a test-suite against the clean_url function.

Prequisities
============

cmake 2.6+

I use cmake instead of a makefile because frankly, who would use a makefile these days??

Usage
=====

1. Build the app (assuming makefiles are default for cmake)
  
  cmake .
  make

2. Run it

  ./clean_url_test

3. Watch the beautiful lines of test output emerge.

4. Don't judge too harsly for a few hours work :(
