# dispatch\_io

Basic demo of using GCD to perform asynchronous IO, specifically reads.

## Running (Mac OS X only, obviously)

./bootstrap

Running bootstrap will generate some test data and the build system, 
then run dispatch\_io.

## Profiling

If you want to profile dispatch\_io using Xcode Instruments, just
swap the cmake generator in ./bootstrap to use -G Xcode then
knock yourself out.
