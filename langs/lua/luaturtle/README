Implements a simple Turtle-like DSL in LUA against a C++ backend.  The Lua
files specify turtle commands such as forward, left, etc while the backend
maintains the turtle's state, interprets commands and renders the results
to a TGA image.

Installing:

You'll need the Lua package oddly enough and cmake. Afterwards run cmake and make:

cmake .
make

For other cmake targets, like Xcode, VS, supply cmake with -G, eg for Xcode:

cmake -G Xcode .
xcodebuild -target luaturtle

Running:

luaturtle reads a single lua script and outputs a TGA image (view with MACOSX preview,
open, or xdg-open on Ubuntu etc..windows, Photoshop?). 

An example, simple.lua and result, simple.tga is included :)

./luaturtle myluafile.lua
